# Global Supply Resilience 360

**Status**: In Development (Phase 1)
**Role**: Enterprise Agentic AI for Supply Chain Risk

## Overview
Global Supply Resilience 360 is an autonomous AI system designed to model, monitor, and mitigate risks in global supply chains. It combines a Neo4j Knowledge Graph, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Agentic AI to provide visibility beyond Tier-1 suppliers.

## Architecture
- **Data Layer**: Synthetic enterprise-scale data generation (20k+ nodes).
- **Graph Layer**: Neo4j Knowledge Graph modeling complex dependencies.
- **AI Layer**: GNNs for link prediction and anomaly detection.
- **Agent Layer**: LangGraph-based agents for reasoning and crisis simulation.
- **UI Layer**: Streamlit dashboard for interactive visualization.

## Setup
1. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. (Optional) Run Neo4j via Docker.
